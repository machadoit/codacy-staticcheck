# Ineffective attempt at generating random number

Functions in the math/rand package that accept upper limits, such
as Intn, generate random numbers in the half-open interval [0,n). In
other words, the generated numbers will be >= 0 and < n â€“ they
don't include n. rand.Intn(1) therefore doesn't generate 0
or 1, it always generates 0.
