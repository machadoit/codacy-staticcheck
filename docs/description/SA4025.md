# Integer division of literals that results in zero

When dividing two integer constants, the result will
also be an integer. Thus, a division such as 2 / 3 results in 0.
This is true for all of the following examples:

	_ = 2 / 3
	const _ = 2 / 3
	const _ float64 = 2 / 3
	_ = float64(2 / 3)

Staticcheck will flag such divisions if both sides of the division are
integer literals, as it is highly unlikely that the division was
intended to truncate to zero. Staticcheck will not flag integer
division involving named constants, to avoid noisy positives.
