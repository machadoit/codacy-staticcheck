# Dubious bit shifting of a fixed size integer value

Bit shifting a value past its size will always clear the value.

For instance:

    v := int8(42)
    v >>= 8

will always result in 0.

This check flags bit shifting operations on fixed size integer values only.
That is, int, uint and uintptr are never flagged to avoid potential false
positives in somewhat exotic but valid bit twiddling tricks:

    // Clear any value above 32 bits if integers are more than 32 bits.
    func f(i int) int {
        v := i >> 32
        v = v << 32
        return i-v
    }
