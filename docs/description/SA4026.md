# Go constants cannot express negative zero

In IEEE 754 floating point math, zero has a sign and can be positive
or negative. This can be useful in certain numerical code.

Go constants, however, cannot express negative zero. This means that
the literals -0.0 and 0.0 have the same ideal value (zero) and
will both represent positive zero at runtime.

To explicitly and reliably create a negative zero, you can use the
math.Copysign function: math.Copysign(0, -1).
