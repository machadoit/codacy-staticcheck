# Type assertion to current type

The type assertion x.(SomeInterface), when x already has type
SomeInterface, can only fail if x is nil. Usually, this is
left-over code from when x had a different type and you can safely
delete the type assertion. If you want to check that x is not nil,
consider being explicit and using an actual if x == nil comparison
instead of relying on the type assertion panicking.
