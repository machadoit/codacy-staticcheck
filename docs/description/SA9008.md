# else branch of a type assertion is probably not reading the right value

When declaring variables as part of an if statement (like in 'if
foo := ...; foo {'), the same variables will also be in the scope of
the else branch. This means that in the following example

    if x, ok := x.(int); ok {
        // ...
    } else {
        fmt.Printf("unexpected type %T", x)
    }

x in the else branch will refer to the x from x, ok
:=; it will not refer to the x that is being type-asserted. The
result of a failed type assertion is the zero value of the type that
is being asserted to, so x in the else branch will always have the
value 0 and the type int.
