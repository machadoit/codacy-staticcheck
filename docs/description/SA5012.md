# Passing odd-sized slice to function expecting even size

Some functions that take slices as parameters expect the slices to have an even number of elements. 
Often, these functions treat elements in a slice as pairs. 
For example, strings.NewReplacer takes pairs of old and new strings, 
and calling it with an odd number of elements would be an error.
