# (*net/url.URL).Query returns a copy, modifying it doesn't change the URL

(*net/url.URL).Query parses the current value of net/url.URL.RawQuery
and returns it as a map of type net/url.Values. Subsequent changes to
this map will not affect the URL unless the map gets encoded and
assigned to the URL's RawQuery.

As a consequence, the following code pattern is an expensive no-op:
u.Query().Add(key, value).
