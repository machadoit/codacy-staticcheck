# Deleting a directory that shouldn't be deleted

It is virtually never correct to delete system directories such as
/tmp or the user's home directory. However, it can be fairly easy to
do by mistake, for example by mistakingly using os.TempDir instead
of ioutil.TempDir, or by forgetting to add a suffix to the result
of os.UserHomeDir.

Writing

    d := os.TempDir()
    defer os.RemoveAll(d)

in your unit tests will have a devastating effect on the stability of your system.

This check flags attempts at deleting the following directories:

- os.TempDir
- os.UserCacheDir
- os.UserConfigDir
- os.UserHomeDir
